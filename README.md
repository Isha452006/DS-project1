# 📊 Sales Prediction Website

This project is a **simple, front-end based web interface** for a sales prediction system. It includes basic HTML and CSS to design a professional-looking webpage that can later be connected with a backend or machine learning model to make it fully functional.

The purpose of this project is to visually present the concept of sales prediction, making it easy for users or stakeholders to interact with the interface and understand the idea behind the system.


## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

- Design a clean and user-friendly **web interface** for a sales prediction tool.
- Provide a foundation for integrating **machine learning** in the future.
- Help businesses **forecast sales**, which assists in better planning, marketing, and inventory management.

Sales prediction helps companies know **how much product may sell** in the future. With that information, they can **avoid overstocking or understocking** and **boost revenue** by taking timely decisions.
